Description of ROMs for LUTs with values for "inverted deltaR square (inv_dr_sq)"

- The values of inv_dr_sq are used in "invariant mass divided by deltaR" conditions (for multiplication with invariant mass).
- Formular for inv_dr_sq values: 1/(deta*0.0435)^2+(dphi*2*PI/144)^2
- ROMs are implemented in BRAMs (36kb).
- Address range splitted in 9 segments for reducing BRAM resources.
- Addresses splitted by the maximum value of inv_dr_sq (datawidth of ROM) in a range.
- For calos resulting the following 9 ROMs:
-- ROM 1: 4096x26 (64x64 address bits, 26 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in first segment)
-- ROM 2: 4096x14 (64x64 address bits, 14 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in second segment)
-- ROM 3: 4096x12 ...
-- ROM 4: 4096x11 ...
-- ROM 5: 4096x14 ...
-- ROM 6: 4096x13 ...
-- ROM 7: 4096x12 ...
-- ROM 8: 4096x11 ...
-- ROM 9: 4096x12 (256x16 address bits, 12 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in ninth segment)
- ROMs are generated with Vivado "managed_ip_project" and stored in ../firmware/ngc
- All 9 ROMs need 16 36kb BRAMs.
- In Virtex 7 chip 1470 36kb BRAMs are available, where 597 are used for other applications. Therefore up to 873 are free for the ROMs.
  A condition with calo objects of same type and same bx needs nr_obj*(nr_obj-1)/2 BRAMs. The maximum object number is 10 (10*9/2*16=720).
- A VHDL module for a wrapper of all ROM segments (../firmware/../gtl/rom_lut_calo_inv_dr_sq_all.vhd) is used in
  ../firmware/../gtl/mass_div_dr_calculator.
- A "invariant mass divided by deltaR" condition is designed in ../firmware/../gtl/calo_calo_mass_div_dr_condition.vhd for calos.
